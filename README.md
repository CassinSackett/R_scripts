# R_scripts
# These scripts were writtten to simulate a population of heterozygosity estimates for analysis of very small sample sizes.

# These data and the rationale are found in: L.C. Sackett, S.K. Collinge, A.P. Martin 2013.  Do pathogens reduce genetic diversity of their hosts?  Variable effects of sylvatic plague in black-tailed prairie dogs. Molecular Ecology 22: 2441-2555. http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/sackett/LorenSackett/Publications_files/Sackett_recolonization_final.pdf 

# The first is a script for heterozygosity randomization procedures:
# In this case, pre-plague vs. post-recolonization heterozygosity in each population separately
# Ho = average observed heterozygosity across loci for each individual

# The second is a script for simulating heterozygosity in a hypothetical population by drawing from values in real populations
# preplague3 are the real heterozygosity values in 3 populations
